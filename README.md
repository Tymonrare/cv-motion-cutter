it's simple logic for remove static background from video(or camera)

there's two projects - for win and linux. It works on linux for shure and i don't know about windows version.

### Linux run

 - You have to install opencv first
 - You can simple add ./CppLinuxCutter as netbeans project in "netbeans ide" or use cmake to build it manually
 
### Win run
 - You have to install opencv first
 - Open visual studio proj in ./cutter folder

\* It use to work with bgimg.jpg as background but i don't remember how exactly
